# startup-success-tcc
Final paper for my post-graduate course in Data Science and Big Data at PUC-MG. It is a model to predict success of startups.

Files can be found at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ILmz3Ahxwk14xVeVyINC-iQ2nDSugRJ/view?usp=sharing
First unzip the files. Then run the scripts.
There are two scripts, one with the exploratory data analysis and the other one with the model that predicts the startup success.

Enjoy!
